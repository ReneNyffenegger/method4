`METHOD4`
============

Method4 is a PL/SQL application to run dynamic SQL in SQL.

## Example

The simplest way to call Method4 is to pass in a literal query to evaluate:

    select * from table(method4.query('select * from dual'));
    
    D
    -
    X

At first that query seems pointless - why not just directly query `select * from dual`?  Method4 provides two benefits - it silently converts LONGs to CLOBs and it allows custom code to control exactly what query is run and returned.

Method4 includes a dynamic mode that runs queries generated by queries and concatenated with UNION ALLs.  This can solve challenging problems such as "count the rows for every table", all within a single SQL statement.

    select * from table(method4.dynamic_query(
        q'[
            select replace(
                q'!
                    select '#TABLE_NAME#' table_name, count(*) a from #TABLE_NAME#
                !', '#TABLE_NAME#', table_name) sql_statement
            from user_tables
            where table_name like 'TEST%'
        ]'
    ));
    
    TABLE_NAME                         A
    ------------------------- ----------
    TEST                           19765
    TEST1                              1
    TEST2                              1
    TEST3                              1
    ...

These queries are powerful but they can also be confusing because of all the quotation marks required to build strings inside strings.  Simplify your queries with the alternative quoting syntax (the "q" strings) and templating (use REPLACE instead of concatenating strings).


## Notes

Method4 is based on the Dictionary Long Application, (c) Adrian Billington www.oracle-developer.net.  Much of this code contains advanced methods thoroughly discussed on his website, http://www.oracle-developer.net/display.php?id=422

Method4 is a simpler, more generic version of that application.  It can be useful for adhoc queries in highly dynamic environments.  For example, an application where the schemas, tables, and columns are table-driven and only known at run time.

Use this program with caution.  Few programs need to be this dynamic.  This package will be slower and buggier than regular SQL.
